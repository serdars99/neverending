Then, the submitted sentence is listed on the right hand panel. <br/><br/>\r\nAfter the voting period, the sentence that has the most “likes” gets picked and is added to the text. <br/><br/>\r\nIf two or more sentences has the same number of likes, the sentence with the least number of dislikes gets picked. <br/><br/>\r\nThen, the next round of voting starts. In the Neverending Text, there is no specific limitation of content, and this is on purpose. The responsibility of the text belongs to you, to me, to everyone. Write well, and the text will be good. Like the well-written sentence and dislike the bad one, and the story will be good. <br/><br/>\r\nAnd we’ll have something good to read. <br/><br/>\r\nAd infinitum.","Characters":"Characters","character":"Character","votedbefore":"You have already voted for this entry.","postedsuccesfully":"Your sentence is submitted","settings":"Settings","anonym":"anonym","logout":"Log out","yourentrychosen":"YOUR SENTENCE IS CHOSEN.","votinglabel":"Below are the sentences written by others.
